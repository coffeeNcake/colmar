This is a Codecademy project for Week 7 Capstone Project: Colmar Academy.

Design Considerations:

Color and font chosen based on wireframe provided.

Header Section
- hover on navigation items to trigger white on gray background

Start Learning Section
- maintain the same size (width and height) of the tiles
- when the screen is resized the size of the tiles remain the same until mobile breakpoint
- font transition when cursor hovers over tiles

Added favicon, social icons and ARIA roles.
